# Welcome to my Playground

This is my Playground to experiment new tools, solutions, features, and integrations that could improve the security of Open Source projects hosted in GitHub.

Here is the place where I experiment on how to move ideas to something concrete that could help people.
You likely came here from a PR or issue where I linked this repository as reference or maybe because you saw a demo somewhere.

Everything you saw here is not in a polished state, so definitely not ready for production. But should be fun. :)
Sorry for the chaos!!
